All of us may have the experience in checking the stock price everyday in the morning. However, we may be too busy with our works and somehow we are too tired to click on or open to the push notifications from the brokerage platforms. Telegram bot alerts are therefore more useful because it is integrated into our day-to-day messaging application which we are a lot more likely to click on.

Firstly, the Yahoo Finance API will be used to get the price changes of the stocks in Hong Kong Market. Its API is written in Python and we will also be using a Python-based library for the Telegram API known as python-telegram-bot. Then the Telegram handler is set up to listen for requests made to the bot.
